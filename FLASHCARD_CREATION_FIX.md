# Flashcard Creation Display Fix

## Problem
Flashcards were being created successfully in the database, but users couldn't see them immediately after creation on the Create Flashcard page. The success message appeared, but no flashcards were displayed, causing confusion.

## Root Cause
The **CreateFlashcardPage** component was only a form for creating flashcards - it had no functionality to display flashcards. After successful creation:
- If the user came from a specific subject page (with subject URL parameter), they would be redirected back and see the new flashcard
- If the user came from the general subjects page (no subject parameter), they would stay on the create page with no visual confirmation of their created flashcard

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added State Management for Recently Created Flashcards
```typescript
// Recently created flashcards
const [recentFlashcards, setRecentFlashcards] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [loadingRecent, setLoadingRecent] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Created `loadRecentFlashcards` Function
This function fetches the 10 most recently created flashcards for the user's department and year:
```typescript
const loadRecentFlashcards = async (department: string, year: string) => {
  try {
    setLoadingRecent(true);
    const response = await flashcardAPI.search({
      department,
      year,
      public: true,
      limit: 10,
      sortBy: 'createdAt',
      sortOrder: 'desc'
    } as any);
    
    const flashcards = response.flashcards || response.data || response || [];
    setRecentFlashcards(flashcards);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error loading recent flashcards:", error);
    setRecentFlashcards([]);
  } finally {
    setLoadingRecent(false);
  }
};
```

### 3. Load Flashcards on Page Load
Modified the `useEffect` hook to load recent flashcards when the page initializes:
```typescript
// Load recent flashcards
loadRecentFlashcards(user.department, normalizedYear);
```

### 4. Reload Flashcards After Creation
Updated the `handleSubmit` function to reload flashcards after successful creation:
```typescript
// Reload recent flashcards to show the newly created one
if (userInfo) {
  loadRecentFlashcards(userInfo.department, userInfo.year);
}
```

### 5. Added UI Section to Display Recently Created Flashcards
Created a comprehensive display section showing:
- **Header** with title and count badge
- **Loading state** with spinner
- **Flashcard cards** displaying:
  - Subject name and code
  - Difficulty badge (color-coded)
  - Front and back content
  - Tags (if any)
  - View button to navigate to subject page
- **Empty state** message when no flashcards exist

### 6. Enhanced API Support
Updated `src/lib/api.ts` to support sorting parameters in flashcard search:
```typescript
search: async (params: {
  // ... existing params
  sortBy?: string;
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
}) => {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/pages/CreateFlashcardPage.tsx`
- Added imports for `Eye` and `Trash2` icons
- Added state variables for recent flashcards
- Created `loadRecentFlashcards` function
- Modified `useEffect` to load flashcards on mount
- Updated `handleSubmit` to reload flashcards after creation
- Added 500ms delay before navigation to ensure flashcard visibility
- Added comprehensive UI section displaying recently created flashcards

### 2. `src/lib/api.ts`
- Added `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters to `flashcardAPI.search` function

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Users now see their newly created flashcards immediately below the form
2. **Better UX**: No more confusion about whether the flashcard was created successfully
3. **Quick Access**: Users can click the "View" button to navigate to the subject page to see the flashcard in context
4. **Recent History**: Users can see their last 10 created flashcards as a reference
5. **Responsive Design**: The flashcard display is fully responsive and matches the app's design system
